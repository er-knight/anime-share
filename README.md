Thank you [manami-project](https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database/) for Anime Database.

<!-- # How does it work?
- There are currently ~26000 animes listed on myanimelist.net.
- Each anime has been assigned an unique id.
- We initialize a string of 0's of length 30000.
- When anime is selected, value at index equal to anime's id is changed to 1.
- For generating a url, values in array concatanated to string.
- Then its sha256 hash is calculated.

- It is done because, user don't need to create account, don't need to share their personal details. -->
